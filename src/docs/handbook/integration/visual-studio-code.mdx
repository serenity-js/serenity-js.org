# Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular code editor that comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.
It also has a [rich ecosystem of extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) to help you with your development tasks, such as running and debugging tests.

Serenity/JS integrates with [industry-standard test runners](/handbook/test-runners/) using their dedicated integration protocols,
which means that to run and debug your Serenity/JS tests in Visual Studio Code you simply need the appropriate extension for your test runner of choice.

## Recommended Extensions

### Cucumber.js

You'll need the following extensions to run and debug your Serenity/JS Cucumber.js tests in Visual Studio Code:
- [Cucumber for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CucumberOpen.cucumber-official) - provides syntax highlighting, code snippets, and Gherkin step autocomplete
- [CucumberJS Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=balrog994.cucumber-test-runner) - allows you to run and debug Cucumber.js tests directly from Visual Studio Code

### Playwright Test

To run and debug your Serenity/JS Playwright Test scenarios in Visual Studio Code, you'll need the following extension:
- [Playwright Test](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) - enables developers to write, run, and debug end-to-end and component tests for web applications using the Playwright Test framework directly within the editor

### WebdriverIO

While there's no recommended WebdriverIO extension for Visual Studio Code yet, you can run and debug your Serenity/JS WebdriverIO scenarios using the [WebdriverIO Test Runner CLI](https://webdriver.io/docs/testrunner).

## Gitpod workspaces

If you prefer to work in a cloud-based development environment, you can use [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) to run and debug your Serenity/JS tests in Visual Studio Code without having to install anything on your machine.

All you need to do is click on the "Open in Gitpod" button in the README
of your Serenity/JS project created using one of the [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/project-templates/),
and Gitpod will launch a ready-to-code workspace for you with all the necessary tools and extensions pre-installed.
