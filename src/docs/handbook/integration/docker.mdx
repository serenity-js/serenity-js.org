# Docker

Serenity/JS Docker images enable you to run Serenity/JS tests in containerised environments,
including CI/CD pipelines, cloud development environments, and local development setups.
The images are maintained in the [serenity-js/serenity-js-docker](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-docker) repository
and published through the [Serenity/JS GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/serenity-js/packages).

## Using Serenity/JS Docker Images

Learn how to integrate Serenity/JS Docker images with your workflow:

- [GitHub Actions](/handbook/integration/github-actions/)
- [GitHub Codespaces](/handbook/integration/github-codespaces/)
- [GitLab CI](/handbook/integration/gitlab-ci/)

## Available Images

### Serenity/JS Playwright image

**Recommended for**: [Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/),
[Cucumber.js with Playwright](/handbook/test-runners/cucumber/), and [WebdriverIO](/handbook/test-runners/webdriverio/) projects using modern browsers.

The Serenity/JS Playwright Docker image provides a complete testing environment with all **Playwright browser engines**, plus the latest stable **Chrome** and **Edge** browsers.
Image versions follow Playwright's versioning convention to ensure compatibility.

## Extending Serenity/JS Docker images

Serenity/JS base images are ready for immediate use,
but there are many situations where layering your own image provides more control.
Common needs include installing system tools, adding language runtimes, embedding corporate CA certificates,
or adjusting environment-level settings for browsers, Node.js, or the JVM.

### Creating a Custom Image

Start by using an official Serenity/JS image as your base. This preserves the full testing toolchain—browsers,
drivers, system dependencies, and Serenity/JS reporting—while giving you space to tailor the environment.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="docker" title="Dockerfile">
{`FROM ghcr.io/serenity-js/playwright:v`}<PlaywrightVersion />{`-noble

# Add your customisations here
`}
</DynamicCodeBlock>

### Adding Custom CA Certificates

Teams using Serenity/JS often run tests against internal services protected by certificates signed by private Certificate Authorities (CAs).
Without installing those CAs, TLS requests from your test suite may fail.
Extending the base image ensures both the OS and Node.js trust your internal CA.

#### Example: Embedding and Trusting Corporate CA Certificates

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="docker" title="Dockerfile">
{`FROM ghcr.io/serenity-js/playwright:v`}<PlaywrightVersion />{`-noble

  # Switch to root to install system-level dependencies
  USER root

  # Copy your custom CA certs into the image.
  # This assumes you have certificates in a local folder named \`certs/\`
  COPY certs/my-company-root-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/

  # Update and rehash the certificates
  RUN apt-get update \\
    && update-ca-certificates \\
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

  # Tell Node.js about the certificates
  ENV NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/my-company-root-ca.crt

  # (Optional) Drop back to a non-root user if the base image supports it
  USER serenity-js
`}
</DynamicCodeBlock>

##### Things to Watch Out For
- **Certificate Rotation**: If you rotate or add new CA certs, you’ll need to rebuild and redeploy the image.
- **Credential Management**: Be careful not to bake in sensitive private keys or credentials unless the image is stored in a secure (private) registry.
- **User Permissions**: Serenity/JS images run under a non-root serenity-js user by default. When installing packages or updating certificates, switch to root temporarily and revert afterwards to maintain secure defaults.

### Building and publishing your custom image

To build and publish your Docker image, follow the instructions from your artifact registry vendor:
- [Artifactory: "Docker registry"](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/docker-registry)
- [GitHub: "Working with the Container registry"](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)
- [GitLab: "Build and push container images to the Container Registry"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/build_and_push_images.html)
