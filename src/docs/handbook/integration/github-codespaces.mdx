# GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) provide cloud-hosted development environments
that run directly in your browser or local [VS Code](/handbook/integration/visual-studio-code/) client.

Official [Serenity/JS Docker images](/handbook/integration/docker/) are fully compatible with GitHub Codespaces,
and all the [Serenity/JS Project Templates](/handbook/project-templates/) include a preconfigured `devcontainer.json` file
to ensure your Codespace:
- Uses the Serenity/JS Playwright Docker image
- Installs recommended VS Code extensions
- Configures port forwarding for any Serenity/JS report servers

To launch a Codespace for any Serenity/JS project, open the repository on GitHub and select [**Code → Create Codespace on main**](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository).

## Customising the Codespace

You can tailor the development environment by editing the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
This is where you can:

- Add or update Dev Container Features
- Extend the toolchain
- Adjust VS Code extensions
- Modify ports, mounts, or environment variables

Below example configuration uses the Serenity/JS Playwright Docker image
and adds [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/github-cli) and [Light-weight Desktop](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/desktop-lite) features:
