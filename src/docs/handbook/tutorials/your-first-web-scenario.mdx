# Your first web scenario

In this guide, you'll learn the basics of web testing with Serenity/JS; I'll show you how to **run and debug existing tests**
and **write new test scenarios**. While we'll focus on helping you **get the basics right**, I'll point you to the more **advanced
techniques** and **patterns** when needed.

My goal with all the Serenity/JS guides in this handbook, including this one, is that they're easy to follow whether
you're a test automation expert or just starting on your journey.
If you found anything here that could have been clearer, please let me know in the comments or
[submit a correction](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js.org/blob/main/src/docs/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario.mdx).

To keep things simple, we'll use a [**Gitpod.io workspace**](/handbook/project-templates/#serenityjs-gitpods) to work with Serenity/JS in your web browser, so there's **no need to install anything** on your computer.
If you prefer to set up Serenity/JS locally instead, follow the installation instructions in [Serenity/JS + Playwright Test project template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template).

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template)

In this tutorial, you'll learn that:
- Serenity/JS works well with popular development environments, including the free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
- Serenity/JS tests are just high-quality code, so all your regular programming tools will work as expected,
- Serenity/JS test scenarios are **actor-centric** and follow the [**Screenplay Pattern**](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern) to help you capture **business domain vocabulary** and **business workflows**,
- Serenity/JS uses an **activity-based** composition model, optimised for readability and code reuse,
- Serenity/JS assertions and synchronisation statements are portable across interfaces and integration tools,
- Serenity/JS has first-class support for TypeScript and the asynchronous nature of the JavaScript runtime.

:::info Pro Tip
If you get lost or stumble upon a problem you're not quite sure how to solve - ask on the **[Serenity/JS Community Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#serenity-js:gitter.im)**.

## Launching your workspace

All [Serenity/JS project templates](/handbook/project-templates/), such as the one we'll use in this chapter,
[support Gitpod.io workspaces](/handbook/project-templates/#serenityjs-gitpods) and are configured to
make it easy for you to use them in a Visual Studio Code-based development environment.
Of course, since Serenity/JS tests are standards-based Node.js code, they'll work just as well in any other modern <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>.

In this tutorial, we'll use the [Serenity/JS + Playwright Test template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template),
which integrates Serenity/JS with the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) web testing library and its dedicated [Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test) test runner.
The test suite we'll work on interacts with a simple to-do list app that you can experiment with at [todo-app.serenity-js.org](https://todo-app.serenity-js.org/).

To launch your workspace, make sure you have a [GitHub account](/community/),
which will make it easier for you to use all the other Serenity/JS resources, too.

Next, launch your Gitpod.io web IDE using the "Open in Gitpod" button below
and sign in to your [Gitpod.io workspace](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template)
using your GitHub account.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template)

:::info Did you know?
Serenity/JS integrates with several popular test runners, such as Cucumber, Mocha, Jasmine and Playwright Test, as well as various web integration tools,
such as Selenium, Playwright and WebdriverIO. Once you know your way around your first [Serenity/JS project template](https://github.com/serenity-js/?q=template&type=all&language=&sort=),
picking the one right for your team and your project will become a breeze.
:::

## Running tests in Visual Studio Code

[Serenity/JS + Playwright Test template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template)
you've just opened in your Gitpod workspace includes several example test scenarios
located under the [`spec` directory](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/tree/main/spec).

You can view them using your [Visual Studio Code Project Explorer sidebar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface), which should show a directory structure similar to this:

<Figure
    caption='Visual Studio Code user interface showing an example test scenario'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/vs-code-ui.png')}
/>

There are two ways to run Playwright tests in Visual Studio Code, and you can do it either by:
- using the play/check mark icon next to the name of the test in a `.spec.ts` file,
- using the play icon in the Visual Studio Code Test Explorer panel, which shows all the test scenarios Visual Studio Code has detected in your project, as per the screenshot below:

<Figure
    caption='Running test scenarios in Visual Studio Code'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/vs-code-running-test-scenarios.gif')}
/>

Once you've inspected the [`spec/recording_items.spec.ts`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/recording_items.spec.ts),
you will notice that we're using two functions provided by the [`@serenity-js/playwright-test`](/api/playwright-test) module that help to organise a test suite:
- [`it`](/api/playwright-test/function/it) - to declare a single test scenario
- [`describe`](/api/playwright-test/function/describe) - to declare a group of test scenarios

Those [`describe`](/api/playwright-test/function/describe) and [`it`](/api/playwright-test/function/it) functions are wrappers around
Playwright Test [`test.describe`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe-1) and [`test`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-call) functions, respectively.

In addition to the functionality offered by Playwright [`test`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-call) function, Serenity/JS [`it`](/api/playwright-test/function/it)
wrapper offers [Serenity/JS-specific test fixtures](/api/playwright-test/interface/SerenityFixtures),
such as [`actor`](/api/playwright-test/interface/SerenityFixtures#actor),
[`actorCalled`](/api/playwright-test/interface/SerenityWorkerFixtures/#actorCalled),
or [`crew`](/api/playwright-test/interface/SerenityFixtures/#crew).
I'll tell you about them in a moment, but first, let's run the scenarios.


:::info Pro Tip

If Visual Studio Code didn't detect any test scenarios in your project, or if it doesn't display the play/check mark icon next to the name of the test,
use the "Refresh Tests" icon in the Test Explorer to reload test configuration.

<Figure
    caption='Visual Studio Code Test Explorer panel showing the "Refresh tests" button'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/vs-code-refresh-tests.gif')}
/>

:::

### Exercises

To get familiar with running Serenity/JS test scenarios in Visual Studio Code, conduct the following experiments:
1. Open [`spec/recording_items.spec.ts`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/recording_items.spec.ts) and run test scenarios such as `it('should clear text input field when an item is added')` individually using the play/check mark icon next to the `it` block. Make sure they're passing.
1. Run a group of test scenarios by clicking on the play/check mark icon next to the `describe` block, such as `describe('Todo List App')`. Make sure they're passing.
1. Run individual test scenarios using Visual Studio Code Test Explorer panel.
1. Navigate from a test scenario in a Visual Studio Code Test Explorer panel to its location in the codebase using the "Go to test" icon next to the name of the test.

## Writing Serenity/JS test scenarios

Now that you know how to run Serenity/JS test scenarios in VS Code, let's talk about what's involved in writing some new ones.

First, add the below code snippet to your existing test suite in [`spec/recording_items.spec.ts`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/recording_items.spec.ts)
by placing it inside the `describe('Todo List App')` block.

```typescript title="spec/recording_items.spec.ts"
describe('Todo List App', () => {

    it('should allow me to add a todo item', async ({ actor }) => {
        await actor.attemptsTo(
            startWithAnEmptyList(),

            recordItem('Buy some milk'),

            Ensure.that(itemNames(), equals([
                'Buy some milk',
            ])),
        )
    })

    // other test scenarios
})
```

Well done, you've just created your first Serenity/JS test scenario!

Make sure that you can run this new scenario and that it's passing, and we'll analyse its structure line by line in just a moment.

<Figure
    caption='Adding a new Serenity/JS test scenario using Visual Studio Code on Gitpod.io'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/vs-code-adding-a-new-serenity-js-scenario.gif')}
/>

As you can see in the listing above, well-written Serenity/JS test scenarios are **concise**, **easy to read**, and **easy to understand**
even to audiences who might not necessarily have background in technology.
That's because Serenity/JS is designed to help you express your scenarios in the **domain language of your company** and **your business**
and avoid incidental detail and low-level implementation noise that could cloud the picture.

### Showing the browser window

So far you've been running your Serenity/JS test scenarios, but didn't get a chance to see the actual
browser interacting with the web app under test. That's because any web browsers used by Serenity/JS project templates
are configured to run in "headless" mode by default so that they don't get in the way and don't interrupt your work.

This setting is configurable, so you can change it when you need to see what's going on under the hood
or to access the developer tools offered by your browser to [debug your test scenarios](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario/#debugging-tests-and-interactive-execution)
or the system under test.

In addition to being able to interact with the browser when running the tests locally, the
[Serenity/JS + Playwright Test GitPod.io workspace](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template)
I have prepared for you comes equipped with [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing),
so you can see the browser on Gitpod.io as well.

To see the browser:
- Enable ["Show browser"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright#show-browsers) checkbox in the Playwright panel
- In the "Ports" panel, open VNC running on port `6080` in "Preview" mode (this step applies only to Gitpod.io)
    - If your "Ports" panel is empty, click the bell in the lower right corner and click the appropriate "Open preview" button.
- Run the test!

<Figure
    caption='Viewing the browser window while running Serenity/JS test scenarios in Visual Studio Code on Gitpod.io'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/vs-code-showing-the-browser.gif')}
/>

If your development environment is not based on Visual Studio Code,
or if your version of Playwright Test Extension for VSCode displays a warning message saying
`Show browser mode does not work in remote vscode`,
you can configure your tests to start the browser
in non-headless mode by setting the `headless` flag to `false` in [Playwright Test configuration file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration):

```typescript title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
import type { SerenityFixtures, SerenityWorkerFixtures } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test';

export default defineConfig<SerenityFixtures, SerenityWorkerFixtures>({
  use: {
    headless: false,
    // ...
  },
})
```

Now that you know how to run the tests, let's get back to code.

### Designing actor-centred test scenarios

You might have noticed that the scenario you've just added starts with an `actor`.
In fact, all Serenity/JS test scenarios are **actor-centred** and start like that.
This design, based on the [**Screenplay Pattern**](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern), helps your test scenarios
move away from automation and integration tools taking centre stage
and instead helps you focus on [**actors**](/api/core/class/Actor)—**people** and **processes** interacting with
the **system under test**.

So what are _actors_? Actors can represent **end-users**, like a shopper interacting with an online store,
or a traveller interacting with a flight booking system. However, actors can also represent **automated processes** and **external systems**
_acting upon_ the system under test.
Examples here could include an external financial data provider submitting asset price information to our batch processing system,
or a website crawler bot scanning a web UI and receiving a different version than a regular user. You can also use actors to represent
**components** of a software system initiating some interaction with the component we're interested in, like a microservice sending requests to another microservice under test.

:::info Remember
**Actors** represent **people** and **external systems** interacting with the system under test.
:::

From the implementation perspective, the [Serenity/JS Playwright Test](/api/playwright-test)
module takes care of initialising and injecting actors into your test scenarios
and dismissing them and freeing their resources when the test scenario is finished.

All you need to do is to use the Serenity/JS [`it` function](/api/playwright-test/function/it) instead of the default Playwright `test` function,
and ask it for an `actor`:

```typescript title="spec/recording_items.spec.ts"
// Use Serenity/JS `describe` and `it` wrappers from `@serenity-js/playwright-test` module:
import { describe, it } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test'

// `describe` groups test scenarios together
describe('Todo List App', () => {

    // `it` injects the `actor` object when a test scenario requests it
    it('should allow me to add a todo item', async ({ actor }) => {
        await actor.attemptsTo(
            // ...
        )
    })

    // ...
})
```

Serenity/JS test scenarios can involve **one or multiple actors**. This is useful, for example, when designing scenarios for contexts
where several actors interact with one another, or where several actors are required to complete different parts of a larger workflow.
Examples of such contexts include multi-user workflow systems, messaging systems, video games, and so on.
You can see an example of a basic multi-actor test scenario in [`spec/multi-actor_scenarios.spec.ts`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/multi-actor_scenarios.spec.ts).

### Modelling workflows using reusable activities

The role of Serenity/JS actors is to interact with the system under test by performing [**activities**](/api/core/class/Activity).

You use activities to model the logical elements of a workflow that an end-user or an external system interacting with the system under test
would perform to accomplish some **goal**.

:::info Remember
**Actors** perform **activities** to interact with the system under test and accomplish their **goals**.
:::

From the implementation perspective, **Serenity/JS activities** are the **most basic form of code reuse** and manifest themselves
as either [_tasks_](/api/core/class/Task) or [_interactions_](/api/core/class/Interaction).
We'll discuss both of those in detail when we talk about the [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern),
but for now let's use the following definitions:
- **Interactions** are the low-level activities that **interact directly** with an interface of the system under test.
  Examples here include an interaction to [click](/api/web/class/Click) on a button in a web UI,
  or one to [send](/api/rest/class/Send) a `POST` request to a REST API.
  Serenity/JS provides [dozens of such interactions](/api/) out of the box, and you can create your own when needed.
- **Tasks** are **composites of other activities**, created to capture **business domain vocabulary**
  and help to make steps in your test scenario reflect **steps in your business workflow**. Examples here might include
  a task to "record a to-do item", "create a customer account", or to "purchase a plane ticket".

In our example, a **task** that accomplishes the **goal** of "record a to-do item" can be achieved by performing three lower-level activities:
- enter the name of the to-do item into the "What needs to be done?" input box,
- press the enter key,
- make sure the item is recorded as expected.

You can try to perform this task yourself at [todo-app.serenity-js.org](https://todo-app.serenity-js.org/):

<Figure
    caption='Demonstration of recording a to-do item'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/todo-app-record-an-item.gif')}
/>

To see how a task like that would be implemented with Serenity/JS,
open [`spec/todo-list-app/TodoItem/tasks.ts`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/todo-list-app/TodoItem/tasks.ts#10)
and review the implementation of a task to `recordItem`:

```typescript title="spec/todo-list-app/TodoItem/tasks.ts"
import { contain } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
import { Task, Wait } from '@serenity-js/core'
import { Enter, Key, Press } from '@serenity-js/web'

import { newTodoInput } from '../TodoApp'
import { itemNames } from '../TodoList'

export const recordItem = (name: string): Task =>           // 1 - reusable function
    Task.where(`#actor records an item called ${ name }`,   // 2 - task description
        Enter.theValue(name).into(newTodoInput()),          // 3 - sequence of lower-level activities
        Press.the(Key.Enter).in(newTodoInput()),
        Wait.until(itemNames(), contain(name)),
    )
```

In the listing above, you can see that a definition of a Serenity/JS task is **compact**, **easy to read**,
and **easy to understand**.
In fact, it reads _almost exactly_ like how I explained the task to you earlier.
This design is intentional and makes your code much more accessible and easier to reason about.

To implement custom tasks like this and capture the language of _your business domain_ all you need is just a few lines of code where you define:
1. a **reusable function**, named after the **goal** an actor will accomplish having performed a given task, e.g. `recordItem`,
2. a **task description**, used for [test reporting](/handbook/reporting/) purposes,
3. a **sequence of lower-level activities** that constitute a task.

What's important to reiterate here is that Serenity/JS activities are designed to be **reusable**.
This means you could write a task like the one to `recordItem` just once
and reuse it in any scenario that needs to record to-do items.
If the steps involved in _how_ an actor would go about recording a to-do item in your system were to change,
you'd only have to update them in this **one place in your codebase** where the task is defined
and not in every single scenario that uses it.

:::info Did you know?
The task decomposition model implemented by Serenity/JS is based on Hierarchical Task Analysis, a technique typically used in User-Centred Design.
You can read more about it in my article ["User-Centred Design: How a 50-year-old technique became the key to scalable test automation"](https://janmolak.com/user-centred-design-how-a-50-year-old-technique-became-the-key-to-scalable-test-automation-66a658a36555).
:::

You can define as many or as few tasks as it makes sense to reflect the workflows in your domain.
You can make your tasks as high-level or as low-level as you wish.
You're not limited to interacting with just the web interfaces either!
In fact, you can make your Serenity/JS actors interact with **any interface of your system under test**,
be it **web UIs**, **REST APIs**, **mobile apps**, or whatever a Node.js program can talk to.

To make your work easier, Serenity/JS modules provide [**dozens of lower-level interactions**](/api/) you can compose your custom tasks from.

This will help you focus on **modelling your business workflows** and **designing your test scenarios** instead of
wasting your time figuring out how to integrate with the given interface or trying to make several incompatible libraries work together.

The Serenity/JS activity-based code reuse model also means that as you evolve the vocabulary of your domain-specific tasks
over time, writing test scenarios becomes easier as you're simply re-arranging existing tasks into new scenarios.

### Using portable assertions

The Serenity/JS activity-based programming model applies to performing [assertions](/handbook/design/assertions) just as well as it applies
to performing [tasks and interactions](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario/#modelling-workflows-using-reusable-activities).
In fact, the Serenity/JS assertion to [`Ensure`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure) is just another interaction
you give to an actor to perform.

Consider the test scenario [you wrote earlier](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario#writing-serenityjs-test-scenarios):

```typescript title="spec/recording_items.spec.ts"
describe('Todo List App', () => {

    it('should allow me to add a todo item', async ({ actor }) => {
        await actor.attemptsTo(
            startWithAnEmptyList(),

            recordItem('Buy some milk'),

            Ensure.that(itemNames(), equals([
                'Buy some milk',
            ])),
        )
    })
})
```

The last activity in the sequence above is an assertion for the actor to [`Ensure.that`](/api/assertions/class/Ensure)
the names of the items in our to-do list meet our [_expectation_](/api/core/class/Expectation):

```typescript
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'

await actor.attemptsTo(
    // ...
    Ensure.that(itemNames(), equals([ 'Buy some milk', ])),
    //          ^ actual     ^ expectation
)
```

All [Serenity/JS assertions](/api/assertions) follow the [**same consistent pattern**](/handbook/design/assertions)
and all the [Serenity/JS expectations](/api/assertions#Index) (such as [`equals`](/api/assertions/function/equals))
are **interface-agnostic**. This design helps to make your test code **portable** across interfaces
and lower-level integration tools and enables you to use a single pattern no matter the type of interface you interact with.

In addition to [interface-agnostic expectations](/api/assertions#Index),
Serenity/JS also ships with [web-specific expectations](/handbook/design/assertions#web-assertions) like [`isVisible()`](/api/web/function/isVisible)
that are portable across web integration tools, such as Playwright, WebdriverIO, or Selenium.

### Analysing assertion failures

You've already seen what happens when an assertion passes. But what happens when it fails?

To experience how you'd go about analysing a Serenity/JS assertion failure,
modify the scenario [you wrote earlier](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario#writing-serenityjs-test-scenarios)
to make it fail:

```typescript title="spec/recording_items.spec.ts"
describe('Todo List App', () => {

    it('should allow me to add a todo item', async ({ actor }) => {
        await actor.attemptsTo(
            startWithAnEmptyList(),

            recordItem('Buy some cake'),

            Ensure.that(itemNames(), equals([
                'Buy some milk',
            ])),
        )
    })
})
```

When you run the scenario again, you'll notice how the advanced support for Visual Studio Code with
[Playwright Test extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright),
enabled by [Serenity/JS Playwright Test](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test) module,
makes it easy to see exactly where the assertion failure has happened.

<Figure

### Exercises

1.  Compare a single-actor scenario in [`spec/recording_items.spec.ts`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/recording_items.spec.ts)
    and a multi-actor scenario in [`spec/multi-actor_scenarios.spec.ts`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/multi-actor_scenarios.spec.ts).
    What differences and what similarities can you see in how the actors are accessed?
1.  Inspect tasks in [`spec/todo-list-app/TodoItem/tasks.ts`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/todo-list-app/TodoItem/tasks.ts).
    What Serenity/JS web interactions do they use? Can you find their usage examples in the API docs of the [`@serenity-js/web`](/api/web) module?
1.  Write another test that adds two items to the to-do list and verifies they've been added correctly. What task can you reuse?
1.  Add another interaction to your new test - an assertion that verifies the number of items in the list: `Ensure.that(itemNames().length, equals(2))`
1.  See if you can create a test that adds 2 items, removes one of them, and then verifies the items that are left. Reuse the existing task to `remove(itemName)`.
1.  Compare the activity-based code reuse model used by Serenity/JS with other code reuse models you've seen used in the context of test automation in the past.
    How do they compare?

## Debugging tests and interactive execution

A [standard Node.js debugger](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started) used by your IDE is designed to deal with basic, imperative code,
and not the declarative programming model used by Serenity/JS. This means that using a [Visual Studio Code debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) to set a breakpoint on one of the activities
given to an actor to perform **will not** have the desired effect. That's because your IDE pauses the scenario when the activity is **declared**
and not when it's **executed**.

Luckily, Serenity/JS has a solution to this problem.

<Figure
    caption='Visual Studio Code debugger pauses execution when the activity is declared, not when it is executed'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/vs-code-imperative-debugging.gif')}
/>

### Debugging test scenarios

To help a Node.js debugger bridge the gap between the imperative and declarative programming models,
Serenity/JS offers [debugging capabilities](/handbook/design/debugging) and the interaction to [`Debug`](/api/core/class/Debug).
To use it, add the following code snippet to your test scenario, making sure to also use Visual Studio Code Quick Fix
feature to add `import { Debug } from '@serenity-js/core'`:

```typescript
Debug.values(() => {
    // highlight-next-line
    // set breakpoint
}),
```

Next, [set a breakpoint](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) on the line indicated by the comment,
and run your test scenario in debug mode to see your IDE pause the execution between actor's activities:

<Figure
    caption='Visual Studio Code debugger pauses execution when the interaction to Debug is invoked'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/vs-code-declarative-debugging.gif')}
/>

### Debugging tasks

The great thing about the interaction to [`Debug`](/api/core/class/Debug) is that you can use it **not just in the top-level
test scenarios**, but also in **any custom Serenity/JS tasks** you define.

To try it out, open [`spec/todo-list-app/TodoApp/tasks.ts`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/todo-list-app/TodoApp/tasks.ts)
and modify the task called `startWithAnEmptyList` by adding the interaction to `Debug` and set a breakpoint on the line indicated by the comment:

```typescript title="spec/todo-list-app/TodoApp/tasks.ts"
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions';
import { Task, Debug } from '@serenity-js/core';
import { Navigate, Page } from '@serenity-js/web';

export const startWithAnEmptyList = () =>
    Task.where(`#actor starts with an empty todo list`,
        Navigate.to('/'),
        Ensure.that(
            Page.current().title().describedAs('website title'),
            equals('Serenity/JS TodoApp'),
        ),
        Debug.values(() => {
            // highlight-next-line
            // set breakpoint
        })
    );

    // ...
```
When you run a scenario using the task to `startWithAnEmptyList` in debug mode,
you'll notice that the execution pauses where you wanted it to pause.
However, setting breakpoints is **not the only thing** the interaction to `Debug` can do.

### Retrieving information using questions

In the [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern), we design our automated tests to model how actors
perform their activities to accomplish their goals. However, performing interactions is just one side of the coin.
The other thing an actor must do is to determine if the behaviour of the system under test meets its acceptance criteria.
To do that, actors need to retrieve information from the system, its execution environment and sometimes additional
data sources.

Serenity/JS models the act of information retrieval as [questions](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern#questions)—an
actor answers a question to obtain some information. Since questions represent a **way for actor to obtain the information**,
and **not the result itself**, they can be used to parameterise actor's activities and resolved whenever the actor gets
to performing the parameterised activity.

:::info Remember
**Actors** answer **questions** to obtain information.
:::

To see examples of how to define Serenity/JS questions, open [`spec/todo-list-app/TodoList/questions.ts`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/todo-list-app/TodoList/questions.ts).

Among several other functions you'll spot `itemNames()`, which should be already [familiar to you](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario#writing-serenityjs-test-scenarios):

```typescript title="spec/todo-list-app/TodoList/questions.ts"
import { includes } from '@serenity-js/assertions';
import { Answerable, d, QuestionAdapter } from '@serenity-js/core';
import { By, PageElement, PageElements, Text } from '@serenity-js/web';

export const items = () =>
    PageElements.located(By.css('.todo-list li'))
        .describedAs('displayed items');

export const itemNames = () =>
    Text.ofAll(items())
        .map(name => name.trim())
        .describedAs('displayed items') as QuestionAdapter<string[]>;

export const itemCalled = (name: Answerable<string>) =>
    items()
        .where(Text, includes(name))
        .first()
        .describedAs(d`an item called ${ name }`) as QuestionAdapter<PageElement>;
```

Just like Serenity/JS activities can be [composed into tasks](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario#modelling-workflows-using-reusable-activities),
Serenity/JS [questions](/api/core/class/Question) can be composed with other questions to transform their results.

:::info Remember
You can compose questions to transform their results.
:::

In particular:
- the question about `items()` resolves to [page elements](/api/web/class/PageElements)
  corresponding to HTML widgets describing entries in the todo-list,
- the question about `itemNames()` retrieves the [text content](/api/web/class/Text) of those elements,
  and applies a simple transformation to [trim](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/trim)
  space characters from both ends of the value,
- the question about `itemCalled(name)` uses Serenity/JS [Page Element Query Language](/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language)
  to retrieve a single item that matches an [expectation](/handbook/design/assertions),

Also note how all the questions define [custom descriptions](/api/core/class/Question#describedAs) for Serenity/JS to use when reporting.

### Debugging questions

To use the interaction to [`Debug`](/api/core/class/Debug) to analyse what a given question resolves to,
modify the scenario [you wrote earlier](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario#writing-serenityjs-test-scenarios):

```typescript title="spec/recording_items.spec.ts"
describe('Todo List App', () => {

    it('should allow me to add a todo item', async ({ actor }) => {
        await actor.attemptsTo(
            startWithAnEmptyList(),

            recordItem('Buy some milk'),

            Ensure.that(itemNames(), equals([
                'Buy some milk',
            ])),

            Debug.values(
                (results, names) => {
                    // highlight-next-line
                    // set breakpoint here
                },
                // one or more questions to analyse
                itemNames()
            )
        )
    })

    // other test scenarios
})
```

When you run the scenario in debug mode and the execution pauses on the line where you've set the breakpoint,
you'll notice that the actor has resolved the question returned by `itemNames()` and
that the [Run and Debug](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) panel
shows the values of `results` and `names` which you specified as your function arguments.

To learn more about how this works, check out the [debugging guide](/handbook/design/debugging).

### Exploring page element locators

The Serenity/JS [Playwright Test module](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test) enables you to leverage the
[locator tuning](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright#tune-locators)
capabilities of the Playwright Test Visual Studio Code extension.
This functionality is provided by Playwright, and more specifically the
[`page.locator`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-locator) API that it offers.

To use it, you'll need to:
- use the interaction to [`Debug`](/api/core/class/Debug) to pause the scenario at a breakpoint,
- use [`PlaywrightPage.current().nativePage()`](/api/playwright/class/PlaywrightPage) from `@serenity-js/playwright`
  to extract a Playwright `page` from the Serenity/JS [`Page`](/api/web/class/Page) that's wrapping it,
- interact directly with the `page.locator` API.

To see how the locator tuning features work in practice,
modify the scenario [you wrote earlier](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario#writing-serenityjs-test-scenarios):

```typescript title="spec/recording_items.spec.ts"
describe('Todo List App', () => {

    it('should allow me to add a todo item', async ({ actor }) => {
        await actor.attemptsTo(
            startWithAnEmptyList(),

            recordItem('Buy some milk'),

            Ensure.that(itemNames(), equals([
                'Buy some milk',
            ])),

            Debug.values(
                (results, page) => {
                    // set breakpoint on the line below
                    // highlight-next-line
                    page.locator('h1')
                },
                PlaywrightPage.current().nativePage(),
            )
        )
    })

    // other test scenarios
})
```

When you run your scenario through a debugger and the execution pauses on the line where you set
the breakpoint, you'll notice that you can **modify the selector** passed to `page.locator`
and that your [browser](/handbook/tutorials/your-first-web-scenario#showing-the-browser-window)
highlights the matching elements **live** as you do it.

### Exercises

To get familiar with debugging Serenity/JS test scenarios in Visual Studio Code, conduct the following experiments:
1. Use the interaction to `Debug` to inspect the value of `Page.current().title()` and `Page.current().url()`
1. Write a scenario that adds an item called "walk the dog" to the to-do list, and use the interaction to `Debug`
   to inspect the value returned by `itemCalled('walk the dog').text()`
1. Explore other methods offered by Serenity/JS [`PageElement`](/api/web/class/PageElement) returned by `itemCalled(name)`.
   How would you check if an element is clickable or visible?
1. Read the guide on [Serenity/JS debugging](/handbook/design/debugging/#exploring-playwright-locators) and experiment
   with live evaluation of locators like `h1`, `footer p`, or `li.todo`

## Test reporting

Serenity frameworks are well-known for their state-of-the-art [reporting capabilities](/handbook/reporting/).
Apart from the excellent [Serenity BDD reports](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter), however,
Serenity/JS can also dramatically improve the standard [Playwright Test reports](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test).
Reports produced for Playwright Test scenarios that follow the [**Screenplay Pattern**](/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern)
automatically include detailed information about actors' activities and much more thorough assertion error reports thanks
to the dedicated [Serenity/JS assertions](/api/assertions) library.

The [Serenity/JS + Playwright Test project template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template)
you've been using in this tutorial is already set up to produce both the Serenity BDD and Playwright Test reports.

To explore them, run the full test suite by invoking `npm test` in your terminal:

<Figure
    caption='Running the full test suite in Visual Studio Code'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/vs-code-test-reporting-npm-test.gif')}
/>

When the test suite is finished, you'll find your [Serenity BDD reports](/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter)
generated under `target/site/serenity`, and served on port `8080` on Gitpod:

<Figure
    caption='Serenity BDD reports'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/vs-code-test-reporting-serenity-bdd.gif')}
/>

[Playwright Test reports](/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/#reporting) are generated
under `playwright-report` and served on port `8181` on Gitpod:

<Figure
    caption='Enhanced Playwright Test reports'
    img={require('@site/static/images/web-testing/your-first-web-scenario/vs-code-test-reporting-playwright-test.gif')}
/>

### Taking screenshots

Serenity/JS can capture screenshots of the system under test either automatically using the [`Photographer`](/api/web/class/Photographer/)
or on demand using the interaction to [`TakeScreenshot`](/api/web/class/TakeScreenshot).

#### Automatic screenshots

To enable automatic screenshots, use your `playwright.config.ts` file to add the [`Photographer`](/api/web/class/Photographer/) to the Serenity/JS
stage [`crew`](/api/playwright-test/interface/SerenityFixtures/#crew) available in Playwright Test [worker processes](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel),
and add the [`SerenityBDDReporter`](/api/serenity-bdd/class/SerenityBDDReporter/) and
[`ArtifactArchiver`](/api/core/class/ArtifactArchiver/) to your reporter process:

```typescript title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
import type { SerenityFixtures, SerenityWorkerFixtures } from '@serenity-js/playwright-test';

export default defineConfig<SerenityFixtures, SerenityWorkerFixtures>({
  reporter: [
      [ '@serenity-js/playwright-test', {
          crew: [
              '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',
              [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' } ],
          ]
          // other Serenity/JS config
      }]
  ],

  use: {
    crew: [
      [ '@serenity-js/web:Photographer', {
        strategy: 'TakePhotosOfFailures',                    // <-- pick a strategy
        // strategy: 'TakePhotosOfInteractions',
        // strategy: 'TakePhotosBeforeAndAfterInteractions',
      } ]
    ],
  },
})
```

:::tip Project-specific configuration
Use [Playwright Projects](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects) to configure
the `Photographer` differently for different environments, browsers, or test suites, while keeping the `SerenityBDDReporter`
and `ArtifactArchiver` configuration the same across all of them.
:::

Automatic screenshots are taken using the active actor's web browser when the desired conditions are met,
as defined by your configured strategy:
- `TakePhotosOfFailures`: takes screenshots of the active actor's browser whenever an assertion fails or an error occurs; this is the best strategy in most scenarios as it reduces the size of the HTML report and helps you quickly identify the cause of any failure
- `TakePhotosOfInteractions`: takes screenshots of the system under test after each actor's interaction; useful for producing comprehensive living documentation
- `TakePhotosBeforeAndAfterInteractions`: takes screenshots of the system under test before and after each actor's interaction; helpful in debugging and troubleshooting

:::tip Multi-actor scenarios
Serenity/JS actor-centric model means that in multi-actor scenarios you'll get screenshots from each actor's browser,
even when the actors [use different browsers](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template/blob/main/spec/multi-actor_scenarios.spec.ts).
:::

#### On-demand screenshots

To take a screenshot on demand, use the interaction to [`TakeScreenshot`](/api/web/class/TakeScreenshot)
and the `ArtifactArchiver` and `SerenityBDDReporter` will automatically add your screenshot to the report:

```typescript title="spec/recording_items.spec.ts"
import { TakeScreenshot } from '@serenity-js/web'
import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
// ...other imports

describe('Todo List App', () => {

    it('should allow me to add a todo item', async ({ actor }) => {
        await actor.attemptsTo(
            startWithAnEmptyList(),

            recordItem('Buy some milk'),

            TakeScreenshot.of('my app'),    // <-- take a screenshot with a description

            Ensure.that(itemNames(), equals([
                'Buy some milk',
            ])),
        )
    })
})
```

:::tip Automatic and on-demand screenshots
Note that you can use both the automatic an on-demand strategies simultaneously.
The most common scenario is to configure the `Photographer` to `TakePhotosOfFailures`,
and use `TakeScreenshot` to capture additional screenshots when needed.
