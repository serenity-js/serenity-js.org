# Proposing enhancements

Serenity/JS welcomes ideas and contributions of all sizes. Before starting any work, check whether your enhancement aligns with community needs:
- Open an issue on the [Serenity/JS GitHub repository](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/issues/new)
- Chat with the team on the [Serenity/JS Community Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#serenity-js:gitter.im) on Gitter

Both options help confirm interest and reduce the chance of duplicate or unnecessary work.

## Working with the Serenity/JS codebase

Once you’re ready to propose a change, follow this workflow.

### Prepare your working environment

**Option A: Use GitHub Codespaces (recommended)**

- [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [Serenity/JS mono-repo](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js)
- [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) in your fork
- Create a GitHub Codespace in your fork: [**Code → Create Codespace on main**](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository)
- After implementing your changes, run the full build:
```shell
make clean verify report
```

**Option B: Develop locally**
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [Serenity/JS mono-repo](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js)
- [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) in your fork
- [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork to your machine
- Install the [runtime dependencies](/handbook/installation/): Node.js LTS and Java Runtime Environment
- Install the Node.js dependencies - Serenity/JS uses [Lerna.js](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), [PnPm](https://pnpm.io/) and [Node.js Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack)
```shell
make install
```
- Verify your environment is set up correctly and all tests are passing:
```shell
make clean test
```

### Implement your changes
- Implement your change and update/add tests
- Run a full local build before submitting:
```shell
make clean verify report
```

### Submit your changes

- Follow the [conventional commits standard](/community/contributing/commit-message-conventions/) when writing commit messages
- Push your branch to your fork
- Open a pull request
- If automated checks fail, update your branch and rebuild until everything passes

## Understanding the Serenity/JS codebase

The Serenity/JS mono-repo includes three main areas:
- [`packages/`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/packages) - Source for all [Serenity/JS modules](/api), along with unit and package-level tests
- [`integration/`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/integration) - Integration tests that run against transpiled JavaScript artifacts
- [`examples/`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/main/examples) - Small sample projects that let you experiment with your changes in a realistic environment

Documentation for the Serenity/JS website lives in a separate repository: [`serenity-js/serenity-js.org`](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js.org)
For documentation-focused contributions, see the [Improving Documentation](/community/contributing/improving-documentation/) guide.

## Building and testing Serenity/JS

The build process is driven by the main [Makefile](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/blob/main/Makefile). Common commands:
- `make` - runs install, clean, compile
- `make install` - installs all mono-repo dependencies
- `make cc` - clears Nx.js build cache
- `make clean` - removes build artifacts
- `make test` - runs unit tests in `packages/*/spec`
- `make integration-test` - runs integration tests in `integration/*/spec`,
- `make verify` - runs linting, transpilation, unit tests, and integration tests
- `make verify report` - full build, generating aggregated test and coverage reports (Run this at least once before submitting a pull request)

If you run into issues, connect with the team via the [Serenity/JS Community Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#serenity-js:gitter.im).
And don't be shy, we're here to help 😊
